    implicit intent is used when specifying the functionallity not the activity
        //  1) Create the intent
        //  2) Verify there is something that can handle that intent
        //  3) start the intent
            if( safe )
                startActivity( intent );
    explicit intent is used when starting an activity in the same application
        Intent intent = new Intent( this, AnotherActivityInTheSame.class );

    Layouts
        Purpose: organize views within a view
        Linear Layouts create either a column of views or a row of views
        Padding adds space between layouts
        Margins are properties of the layouts
        Relative Layouts shows layouts in relation to its siblings
        List View: column of layouts
        Grid View: 
    Guideline: Prefer shallow layout hierarchies to deep hierarchies
        for performance
    Specifying View Height and Width
        match_parent = stretch to the size of the parent View (minus padding) but no larger
        wrap_content = make big enough to enclose its content ( plus padding) but no larger
        absolute size (best to use dp)
    Layout Weight
        to which children should any extra space be given? The important ones, of course!
        weight roughly equal to importance
            child a has weight 1
            child b has weight 2
            child c has weight 3

            total weight = 6;  a = 1/6, b = 1/3, c = 1/2
        To have equally sized children
            set 0dp to height and set weights to 1
