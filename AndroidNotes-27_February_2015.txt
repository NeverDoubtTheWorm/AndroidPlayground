HW05: Write an application that 
	allows the user to specify a URL
	[In the background] check the contents of that site for the word "tiger" [case insensitive]
 	if it does not:
 		Pop-up a toast with an image that tells the user that the site is "uninteresting" and should be ingnored
 	else
 		pop-up a toast with an image that tells the user that the site should be bookmarked
 		Take them to that site (after a quick break to let them read the message)
 	for fun: use Java''s Pattern class {} to do the matching
How to "activate" an activity

Another Activity in the same Application
	We''ll need to create an explicit Intent
		The word explicit denotes that we are specifying exactly which class {} to "activate"
			Intent intent = new Intent( this, AnotherActivityClassName.class );
		To "trigger" the Intent
			startActivity( intent );
An Activity in a different Application
	We''ll need to create an implicit Intent
		the word implicit denotes the functionality that we want to trigger, but does not specify which Application or which Activity from that application will be run
		three step process to trigger the Intent
		[note: this example will be an Intent that allows us to view a website in a browser app]
			Create the Intent
				Uri site = Uri.parse( "http://tigers.com" );
				Intent intent = new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW, site );
			Verify there is something on the device that can handle that Intent // for safety
				PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
				List<ResolveInfo> activities = pm.queryIntentActivities( intent, 0 );
				boolean safe = activities.size() > 0;
			Start the Intent
				if( safe )
					startActivity( intent );
Set Hierarchical Parent to MainActivity
In res/drawable click new => image asset
	new=> drawable resource file
	choose for src for button

	public void dontButtonHandler( view v ){ // in mainActivity
		Intent intent = new Intent( this, FinalWarningActivity.class );
		startActivity( intent );
	}
	public void warningButtonHandler( view v ) { // in FinalWarningActivity
		// create intent
		Uri site = Uri.parse( "http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~dts/pix/scarymonster.jpg" );
		Intent intent = new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW, site );
		// verify existance of handler
		PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
		List<ResolveInfo> activities = pm.queryIntentActivities( intent, 0 );
		boolean safe = activities > 0;
		// start the intent
		if( safe )
			startActivity( intent );		
	}
