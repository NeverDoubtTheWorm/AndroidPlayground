Fragment-based UIs
		Why?
			act as components that can be shared by multiple activities
			swap fragments in/out in the current Activity
		ASIDE: mock-up the UI before you begin coding
			not only layout, but also navigation [ how the UI changes in response to user actions ]

	Loading fragments into an Activity
		Two ways
			set the View''s Content using a Layout
					setContentView( R.layout.news_articles )
				con: cannot dynamically swap the fragments
			use the Fragment Manager to programmatically insert the Fragment

				pro: allows the fragments to be dynamically swapped
