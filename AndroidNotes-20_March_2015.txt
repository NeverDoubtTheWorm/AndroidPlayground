Relative Layouts

Defining View ideas in a separate file
    file name: ids.xml
        <?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "utf-8">
        <resources>
            <item   name = "first-id"
                    type = "id"
                />
            <item   name = "second-id"
                    type = "id"
                />
            <item   name = "third-id"
                    type = "id"
                />
        </resources>
    this allows the layout to use these predefined ids "@id/an-id-name"
    and Java code to use these predefined ids
