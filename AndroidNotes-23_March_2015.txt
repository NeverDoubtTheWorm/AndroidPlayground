Quickie Pattern intro
    Adapter
        Allows objects we write to work with existing GUI widgets
            ListView of Views
                each view has a Layout which defines how that list item will be displayed
            an Adapter is used to populate the View with the data from our data source
    Observer
        Allows objects to (un)subscribe for notifications when an "interesting" object''s state changes
