Quiz 5 redux:
    Margins and Padding
        Padding is extra space around content that has the same color as the background of the view
        Margins are extra space around content that has the same color as the parent of the view
    4 techniques for specifying a view''s dimension
        wrap parent
        wrap content
        absolute
        using weights
    why define veiw ids in a separate file?
        allows you to specify all or a subset of your views in one location
        allows you to reuse names across activities
        allows you to share names across activities and fragments
            gives you a stronger type checking mechanism
        file lives in / /ids.xml
    What 4 things need to be done for ListView
        get reference to ListView
        create an adapter
        associate adapter and ListView
        add listnerEvents that we would like
    How did you make a swatch ( hacky )
        empty textview with background color
    Parameters for ArrayAdapter
        context
        layout for each item in the list
    Reason for ViewHolder
        save time by having references to the views so we would not have to look them up by id
    Howto implement ViewHolder?
        Check if its been tagged
        if not
            store references to objects by setting the tag
        user references from tag to set items for listitem
Loaders, ContentProviders, & more!
    

    { ContentProvider }  <----> { ContentResolver }
            /|\                        /|\
             |                          |
            \|/                        \|/
       { SQLite DB}               { CursorLoader }  <----- { LoaderManager }
                                       /|\
                                        |
                                       \|/
         { ListView }  <-------> { CursorAdapter }

    ContentProvider
        purpose: manage a centralized data repository
            example that data will be stored in a SQLite DB, but it need not be.
        Allows other apps to use your app''s data
        Exchanges data in a "table-like" form
    ContentResolver
        used to interact with a ContentProvider
        gives us the basic CRUD ops
    Loader [e.g., CursorLoader ]
        purpose: load data asynchronously in an activity or a fragment
            monitors the data source and automatically update whenever the data source''s content changes
            cache data that survives being detached from an activity/fragment
                the data are available when attached to a new{} activity/fragment
            e.g., AsyncTaskLoader is subclassed for monitoring general data sources
            e.g., CursorLoader is used specifically with SQlite DBs 
    SimpleCursorAdapter
        purpose: efficiently interface a CursorLoader and a ListView
